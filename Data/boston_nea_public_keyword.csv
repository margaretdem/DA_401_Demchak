Begun initially with funding from the Arts Endowment and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the National Dance Project (NDP) recognizes the unique importance of touring to the health of the dance field. The overall goal of NDP is to provide sustained national support for the development and availability of contemporary dance. Presenters and artists create comprehensive projects for dance presentation in order to advance the art form and build audiences around the country. The NDP revolves around a series of key concepts including hub sites, dance alliances, production and touring. To date, NDP projects have taken place in 32 different states and involved more than 91 presenters and 16 different dance companies. Projects were initially developed at hub sites around the country in New York, Texas, Colorado, Vermont, California, Illinois, Florida, Washington, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and Ohio. Subsequently, hub sites in cooperation with other presenters in their region, work to ensure additional performance and workshop opportunities for the dance companies.
