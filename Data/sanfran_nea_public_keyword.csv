Curtis from the perspective of his Indian subjects and their descendants, intended for national broadcast on PBS. Between 1900 and 1930 Edward S. Curtis photographed and recorded more than eighty American Indian tribes--from Mexico to the Arctic, from the Rockies to the Pacific--creating an astonishing body of work: forty thousand photographs, the first full length ethnographic motion picture, ten thousand wax cylinder recordings, twenty volumes of ethnographic text with accompanying portfolios, and several books of Indian stories. By the beginning of the 20th century, the American Indian population had been reduced to five per cent of their pre-contact numbers. Curtis and his contemporaries had good reason to fear that all Indian cultures would vanish. Often accused of romanticizing his subjects, he wanted to show the beauty of Indian life and framed out the poverty and signs of acculturation on the reservations. He frequently showed people in traditional or ceremonial dress, engaging in activities that in some cases hadn't been practiced in many years.

The exhibition of 40 works will survey the sculptural aesthetics and technological innovations in metal enameling which have won Schwarcz the admiration of the American craft community for four decades. Long in the forefront of metal artists, Schwarcz was recently awarded the American Craft Council's Gold Medal for highest achievement in craftsmanship. Early in her career, in the mid-1950's, she became an expert in the basse taille technique in which she etched designs into copper and then enameled them over the entire surface. In her present work, she uses thin copper foil much like a textile, manipulating the pieces into sculptural forms by folding, creasing, and sewing seams with exposed stitches. The pieces are then enameled with transparent color allowing the textures below to show through, and then fired many times completing a process that is so complex and time consuming that Schwarcz may finish only 15 pieces a year. A full-color catalogue will accompany the exhibition and a video of the artist working in her studio will be produced, although they are not part of this proposal.",1998,11,7500,1998-05-01,1999-04-30,0.0,0.0,0.03822700024051122,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1

The philosophy is to advance arts education without promoting a specific aesthetic or educational methodology. Each school will develop a plan and carry out activities to suit the character and needs of its stakeholders, and to strengthen its curriculum in accordance with state- and district-level arts education guidelines. Project-directed activities will include: an orientation for school principals; a professional development day for over 200 educators; financial support and technical assistance to the schools; and an arts education workshop series for interested teachers.
