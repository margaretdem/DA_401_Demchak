This is the GitHub repository for my senior Data Analytics research. I have researched public art and National Endowment of the Arts grants. This repo includes:

- Data and aggregation files for preliminary research
- Data of NEA grants in 6 US cites
- Data cleaning and aggregation files
- Report of study 

- The preliminary folder contians data and analysis of the project in the first phase. The project direction changed slightly after phase 1 and again after phase 2. It also contians a data folder with the raw data used. 
- The Data folder contains the raw data and cleaned datafiles for phase 3 of the project.



This research was conducted in January 2023-May 2023
